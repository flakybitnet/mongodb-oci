# MongoDB OCI

Container images of MongoDB database.

## Goal

Since version 5, MongoDB supports only processors with AVX instructions extensions.  
If you try to run it on an old processor, then you'll get an error like below:
```
/opt/bitnami/scripts/libos.sh: line 346:    58 Illegal instruction     (core dumped) "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1
```
So, the goal of the project is to provide the ability to run an application on generic `amd64` architecture.

## Images

Our images are based on Bitnami's and published in [Quay](https://quay.io/repository/flakybitnet/mongodb-server),
[GHCR](https://github.com/flakybitnet/mongodb-oci/pkgs/container/mongodb-server), [AWS](https://gallery.ecr.aws/flakybitnet/mongodb/server) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.flakybit.net/fb/mongodb-oci/container_registry) registries.

They also contain the [healthcheck utility written in Rust](https://github.com/syndikat7/mongodb-rust-ping).

## Usage

You can use it in Docker as simple as:
```
$ docker run -d quay.io/flakybitnet/mongodb-server:<version>
$ docker run -d ghcr.io/flakybitnet/mongodb-server:<version>
$ docker run -d public.ecr.aws/flakybitnet/mongodb/server:<version>
$ docker run -d registry.flakybit.net/fb/mongodb-oci/server:<version>
```

## Binaries

Binaries are compiled by following [the instruction](./Build.md) and are available [there](https://gitlab.flakybit.net/fb/mongodb-oci/-/packages/).

## Source

Source code are available at [GitLab](https://gitlab.flakybit.net/fb/mongodb-oci) and mirrored to [GitHub](https://github.com/flakybitnet/mongodb-oci).
